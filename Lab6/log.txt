Partner: Hao Nguyen

Server:

1. Loaded up Ubuntu on my computer, opened up the terminal, and set up
the environment by checking openssh-server and openssh-client are
installed and installing whatever I am missing with dpkg
--get-selections | grep openssh (check) and sudo apt-get install
openssh-server/client (install)

2. Used the command sudo useradd -d /home/hao -m hao to create an
account for my partner

3. Used the command sudo passwd hao to create a password

4. Changed directories with cd /home/hao

5. Used the command sudo mkdir .ssh to make a .ssh directory for my
partner

6. Used the command sudo chown -R hao .ssh to make my partner the
owner of the .ssh directory and everything in it

7. Used the command sudo chmod 700 .ssh to give my partner all
privileges on the .ssh directory

8. Used ifconfig to find my IP address and exchanged IP addresses

Client:

1. Partner's IP was 169.232.106.40

2. Used ssh-keygen to generate a key pair

3. Used ssh-copy-id -i yang@169.232.106.40 to copy the key to my
partner's server

4. Used ssh-add to add the private key to ssh-agent

5. Used ssh -X yang@169.232.106.40 to ssh to the server and ran a
command xterm
