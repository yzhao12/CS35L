1. The network would still be secure because the data sent over the
network are all encrypted with the session key

(1). The network would still be secure because keystrokes do not
betray anything about the contents of the public, private, and session
keys that were generated, so the other teams would still not be able
to decrypt the information sent over the network without the keys

(2). The network would be compromised because if the other teams could
see and copy files from our USB drive, then they can copy the key pair
that was generated and use the keys to decrypt the messages we send
over the network

2. The verify command only verifies that the signatures on the
file matches, but the key used to generate that signature could be
made under any name. So a random person could use my name to create a
key, and they generate a signature for a file, and gpg --verify would
say that the signature matches. To solve this problem, we could
establish an official database for every individual and his or her
key, so the command can look up which key matches which person. And a
person can only have one key.
