1. This removal was not necessary, because "case_long_iso_time_style:"
was a label for a goto statement. Since the goto statement that went
to that label was removed in the second hunk, this label became
inactive and would do nothing even if it was not removed.

2. In the patch notes, it states that "ls -l now uses the traditional
three field time style....in locales where a specific style has not
been specified". So if this patch is used in a country where people
don't speak English and they do not have a specified style, then ls -l
will print the date such that the English month abbreviations
will not be understood by the non-English speakers and they will also not
understand the English time format. Also, scripts which relied on the
previous date format will be confused when parsing the dates.

3. Running the script on an empty file causes an IndexError: index out
of range. This is because the list of lines gets passed into random's
choice function, and the choince function raises IndexError if the
list of lines is empty.

4. When run with python3, there is a SyntaxError: invalid syntax
raised for line 65 (except IOError as (errno, strerror):). This is
because python3 has a different syntax for using IOError.
