1. Measuring the time it takes for sfrobu and sfrob to run
Using frobtime1, which is a file with 500 random strings

time ./sfrob <frobtime1
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.001s


time ./sfrobu <frobtime1
real    0m0.009s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.005s

Comparisons: 3832


Using frobtime3, modified to have 1000 random strings

time ./sfrob <frobtime3
real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.002s


time ./sfrobu <frobtime3
real    0m0.015s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.013s

Comparisons: 8668
 

Using frobtime5, modified to have 2000 random strings

time ./sfrob <frobtime5
real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.001s


time ./sfrobu <frobtime5
real    0m0.031s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.026s

Comparisons: 19383


In the 500 and 1000 random string files, sfrob is much faster
than sfrobu, about 4 or 5 five times faster. And in the 2000 random
string file, sfrob is 8 times faster than sfrobu.


Number of Lines: 500    Comparisons: 3832
Number of Lines: 1000   Comparisons: 8668
Number of Lines: 2000   Comparisons: 19383

Based on these numbers, the number comparisons as a function of the
number of lines N is about Nlog(N).


2. Comparing sfrobs to sfrob and sfrobu


Using frobtime1, which is a file with 500 random strings
time ./sfrobs <frobtime1
real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.007s


Using frobtime3, a file with 1000 random strings
time ./sfrobs <frobtime3
real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.005s


Using frobtime5, a file with 2000 random strings
time ./sfrobs <frobtime5
real    0m0.013s
user    0m0.007s
sys     0m0.005s


Compared to sfrob and sfrobu, sfrobs is in the middle
performance-wise, the times are all lower than those of sfrobu, but
higher than those of sfrob.
